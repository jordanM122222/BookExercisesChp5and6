I honestly feel the Professors answers, explanations, and formulas,
are more efficient and easier to understand than the Virtual assistant and
my answers. I should have looked at them before seeking out my own answers.

The professors answers were more thorough and particular to the pertaing questions.
To be completely honest, Im not sure if they can be improved, the formulas
and explanations make sense, I can imagine theres more than one way to get
the answers, but I am not for certain.
